# I Need to Write

This project is for my Evening Cohort (EC13) capstone. It is a journaling app but will a little bit of a twist. It is meant for those who are already avid journalists as well as those who may be new to journaling and want to make it a habit.

  

## Motivation

The motivation of this project Is that I am an avid journaler. I started journaling several years ago after much prompting from my mother. She felt that it would help me as I was struggling through some challenges in life. Fast forward to now and I journal pretty much every single day. I also started journaling to my two young daughters. While they are too young to read what I have written to them right now my hope is that one day I can give them access to what I have written to them. I hope that it will just provide more context about how much they are loved, more insight into who their father is, etc.

  

This journaling app will be geared to people who want to journal to loved ones as well as just starting a daily habit of journaling. The user will be able to journal to multiple loved ones in separate journals. They will be able to perform full CRUD on individual journals that they can gear towards a special special people in their life.
