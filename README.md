# I Need to Write
This project is for my Evening Cohort (EC13) capstone. It is a journaling app but will a little bit of a twist. It is meant for those who are already avid journalists as well as those who may be new to journaling and want to make it a habit. 

## Motivation

I journal on a daily basis. Journaling has helped me tremendously over the last several years. Every now and then I journal to each of my daughters. Currently my daughters have no idea about this since they are currently 4 years old and 2 years old. 

This journaling app will be geared to people who want to journal to loved ones as well as just starting a daily habit of journaling. The user will be able to journal to multiple loved ones in separate journals. They will be able to perform full CRUD on individual journals that they can gear towards a special special people in their life.
